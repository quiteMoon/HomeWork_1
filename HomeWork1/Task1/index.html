    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
    <p1>Two households, both alike in dignity, <br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p1>
    <h2>SCENE Ð†. Verona. A public place.</h2>
    <p2>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p2>
    <h2>SAMPSON</h2>
    <p3>Gregory, o`my word, we`ll not carry coals</p3>
    <h2>GREGORY</h2>
    <p4>No, for then wo should be collier</p4>
